    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      Web development has introduced me to new ways of expressing my creativity in an almost  limitless environment, which encourages originality.
      Aside from programming, I am a guitarist of 10 years, and also play piano and bass. Throughout my time in education, I have been involved in many
      musical ensembles, from Jazz bands to male acappella groups, rock bands to a chamber choir. I have thoroughly enjoyed performance, taking part in
      multiple concerts every year, and school musicals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer of 2013 saw my brother and I travel around Europe, camping in the Chamonix valley, navigating Rome, and exploring Corfu.
      I have completed a charity skydive, raising over Â£300 for "Free Tibet", as part of a Citizenship project.

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
      During the summer 2013, I worked at a Kendal-based company called Simple Solutions, developing with PHP, MySQL and Python, to create a system to
      display data from the MT4000 telemetry device on a webpage updating in realtime using AJAX.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of my A Level Computing course, I developed a web-based home security system. This consisted of a Raspberry Pi capturing frequent images, which were securely sent to my server, before being stored and displayed
      on a webpage updating in real time when a new picture was available.
    </p>

    <h3>Languages</h3>
    <p>
      I have developed with:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>VB.Net</li>
        <li>GML</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      I also have some experience with Java.
      I am familiar with using the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> CSS library.
      Integration of MySQL into the websites has been integral to the development I have done, and I am familiar with developing both front and back end.
    </p>

    <h3>Systems</h3>
    <p>
      My OS of choice for development is Ubuntu, and have experience working with Ubuntu Server.
      I have also worked with the Raspberry Pi frequently both as part of my school project and in my own time.
