## A Website Overhaul

So I've got to that stage again where I'm hugely unhappy with my personal website,
so an overhaul is in order. I've also got to a point where I'm struggling with things 
to write about, so why not blog about the overhaul?

# Requirements

Firstly, the new design should be simpler. Much simpler. A while ago, a highly respected
web developer suggested to me to build websites that function cleanly if the CSS doesn't
load. Weird, I thought - it's rare for the CSS not to load on a webpage? It was only
afterwards I clicked it wasn't really for the fact it might not load, but it steers
you towards writing clean markup.

My second requirement is to reduce the load speed, by decreasing the file sizes right
throughout the website. Currently the website is **2.3MB** in size, taking **2.88s** to load. I am going to aim to
reduce it down to **230KB** with a load time of **< 1s**.

The first thing I'll do is come up with a design to replace the current theme I am using.
This should be minimal, and I highly expect to completely remove the current theme and
start from scratch.
