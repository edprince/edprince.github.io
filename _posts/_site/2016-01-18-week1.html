<p>So we have just started the robot bargain hunt task, and I have a reasonable
outline of what the project is aiming for. We need to implement a searching and
sorting algorithm along with a GUI to create a program that locates bargains. To
begin with we have created a public git repository, hosted on GitHub, and all
tested pushing our own example work to it. Along with this we are also
communicating using Gitter, which is fantastic for integrating other
applications with, such as Trello, which we are using to create lists of
components that need to be implemented, ideas, deadlines etc. Along with this,
we are using Travis CI in order to make use of continuous integration. For any
functions/code we write, we can have unit tests and such to make sure they are
working, and also prevent the code from being broken in the future. All this
data is also delivered straight to Gitter making it easily visible for everyone
in the group.</p>
